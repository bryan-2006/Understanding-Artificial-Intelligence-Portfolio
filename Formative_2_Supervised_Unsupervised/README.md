# Formative Project: Supervised & Unsupervised Learning

This project explores fundamental machine learning techniques using the WHO Life Expectancy dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains life expectancy, health factors, and economic factors for countries around the world.

## Notebooks

- **workshop_2.ipynb**: Supervised learning techniques (regression and classification)
- **workshop_3.ipynb**: Unsupervised learning techniques (clustering and dimensionality reduction)

## Key Techniques

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Visualization of results

## Results

- Successfully predicted life expectancy based on health and economic factors
- Identified clusters of countries with similar health profiles
- Discovered key factors influencing life expectancy across different regions

## Running the Analysis

1. Ensure data is downloaded: `python download_data.py`
2. Open and run the notebooks: `jupyter notebook`
   git
