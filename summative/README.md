- Regression analysis
- Customer segmentation

## Project 2: Vehicle Damage Inspection

Computer vision model to classify vehicle damage types from images.

### Dataset

Images of vehicles with various types of damage.

### Notebook

- **VehicleDamageInspectionModel.ipynb**: CNN model for damage classification

### Techniques

- Transfer learning
- Image preprocessing
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Model evaluation and fine-tuning
